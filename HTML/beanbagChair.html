    <h1>Beanbag Chair Pattern</h1>

    <!--description of the pattern-->
    <h2>This pattern will fit about 40 mid size Squishmallows inside it. The beanbag
         has hole that ties in the back to insert the Squishmallows.</h2>

    <h3>Now all you have to do is stuff the beanbag with Squishmallows! Then you can tie the 
        back up so they don't fall out. The size doesn’t really matter—I managed to fit a 2-foot-wide 
        Squishmallow in the beanbag; it just took some finagling.</h3>
