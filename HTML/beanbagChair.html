    <h1>Beanbag Chair Pattern</h1>

    <h3>Materials: Yarn, Crochet Hook, Skissors, Lardge Sewing Needle, and Squishmallows</h3>

    <h3>Notes: Every stitch is crocheted in a CH Space. An INC is a Tripple Crochet: TB, CH 5, 
        TB. A DEC is a TB but you don't pull through  the last 2 loops, start a TB in the next 
        CH Space but don't finish it, now Yarn Over and pull through all 4 loops on the hook.</h3>

    <h3>Stitches: Chain = (CH), Slip Stitch = (SLST), Tripple Crochet or Trebble Crochet = (TB), Magic Ring = (MG)
        Chain Space = (CHS), * = (SLST into 4th CH, SLST 3X into CHS).</h3>

    <p>Beanbag:<br>
        RND 1: MG, CH 9 (counts as 1 TB and CH 5), (TB, CH 5) 5X, SLST into 4th CH, SLST 3X into CHS.<br>
        RND 2: CH 9 (counts as 1 TB and CH 5), TB into same CHS, CH 5, (INC, CH 5) 5X, *.<br>

    <h3>Now all you have to do is stuff the beanbag with Squishmallows! Then you can tie the 
        back up so they don't fall out. The size doesn’t really matter—I managed to fit a 2-foot-wide 
        Squishmallow in the beanbag; it just took some finagling.</h3>
