    <h1>Sweatshirt Sleeves Pattern</h1>

    <!--description of the pattern-->
    <h2>This pattern is about a medium and the sleeves are fitted.
    </h2>

    <img src = "../IMGs/CrochetNettedTankTop.jpg" alt = "Netted Tank Top">

    <h3>
        Materials: 3 Yarn colors: Pink, White, and Blue, 
        Crochet Hook, Skissors, Lardge Sewing Needle.
    </h3>

    <h3>Notes: If you like a looser fitting sleeve then do not DEC on rows 1-2. 
        And then with the first round of the cuff you are going to SC in 
        the CH spaces and DEC in each CL.
    </h3>

    <h3>Stitches: Chain = (CH), Single Crochet = (SC), Double Crochet = (DC), Cluster Stitch = (CL), Cluster Decend = (DEC), Back Loops Only = (BLO), Slip Stitch = (SLST), Stitches = (ST).</h3>

    <h3>Special Stitches: CL = 2 Double Crochets in the same CH space.</h3>

    <p>Sleeves, Make 2:<br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">Cut off the sleeves at the shoulder seam leaving about half an inch of extra fabric for the backstitches.</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">Take a long peice of yarn and backstitch all the way around the hole making sure the front of the stitches are on the outside of the sweatshirt.</label><br><br>
        The next part of this is tricky. You probably won't have the same amount of stitches on each sleeve so for the first two RNDs the amount of Stitches doesn't matter. However for RND 3 you just have to make sure that the RND has 24 CL STs.
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 1: Attatch the yarn with a DC into a backstitch, DC into same ST, DC 2 in each ST around, SLST in first DC.</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 2: </label>
