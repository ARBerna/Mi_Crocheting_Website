    <h1>Sweatshirt Sleeves Pattern</h1>

    <!--description of the pattern-->
    <h2>This pattern is about a medium and the sleeves are fitted.
    </h2>

    <img src = "../IMGs/SweatShirtSleeves.jpeg" alt = "Netted Tank Top">

    <h3>
        Materials: 3 Yarn colors: Pink, White, and Blue, 
        Crochet Hook, Skissors, Lardge Sewing Needle.
    </h3>

    <h3>Notes: If you like a looser fitting sleeve then do not DEC on rows 35 or 38. 
        And then with the first round of the cuff you are going to SC in 
        the CH spaces and DEC in each CL.
    </h3>

    <h3>Stitches: Chain = (CH), Single Crochet = (SC), Double Crochet = (DC), Cluster Stitch = (CL), Cluster Decend = (DEC), Back Loops Only = (BLO), Slip Stitch = (SLST), Stitches = (ST).</h3>

    <h3>Special Stitches: CL = 2 Double Crochets in the same CH space, DEC = Double Crochet in one CH space then Double Crochet in the next CH space and this will now count as 1 CL.</h3>

    <p>Sleeves, Make 2:<br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">Cut off the sleeves at the shoulder seam leaving about half an inch of extra fabric for the backstitches.</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">Take a long peice of yarn and backstitch all the way around the hole making sure the front of the stitches are on the outside of the sweatshirt.</label><br><br>
        The next part of this is tricky. You probably won't have the same amount of stitches on each sleeve so for the first two RNDs the amount of Stitches doesn't matter. However for RND 3 you just have to make sure that the RND has 24 CL STs.<br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 1: Attatch the yarn with a DC into a backstitch, DC into same ST, DC 2 in each ST around, SLST in first DC.</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 2: Turn, CH 2, DC in same CH Space, CH 1, (CL 1, CH 1, DEC 1, CH 1) all around, you may end on a CL instead of a DEC, SLST in first DC.</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 3: Turn, CH 2, DC in same CH Space, CH 1, (CL 1, CH 1) and (DEC 1, CH 1) as much as needed all around to get to 24 ST. Try to keep the DECs spread out, SLST in first DC. (24 CL)</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 4-9: Turn, CH 2, DC in same CH Space, CH 1, (CL 1, CH 1) all around, SLST in first DC. (24 CL)</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 10: Turn, CH 2, DC in same CH Space, CH 1, (CL 1, CH 1) 2X, DEC 1, CH 1, (CL 1, CH 1, DEC 1, CH 1) 4X, (CL 1, CH 1) 3X, DEC 1, CH 1, (CL 1, CH 1, DEC 1, CH 1), SLST in first DC. (17 CL)</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 11-34: Turn, CH 2, DC in same CH Space, CH 1, (CL 1, CH 1) all around, SLST in first DC. (17 CL)</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 35: Turn, CH 2, DC in same CH Space, CH 1, (CL 1, CH 1) 5X, DEC 1, CH 1, (CL 1, CH 1) 8X, DEC 1, CH 1, SLST in first DC. (15 CL)</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 36-37: Turn, CH 2, DC in same CH Space, CH 1, (CL 1, CH 1) all around, SLST in first DC. (15 CL)</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 38: Turn, CH 2, DC in same CH Space, CH 1, (CL 1, CH 1) 6X, DEC 1, CH 1, (CL 1, CH 1) 5X, SLST in first DC. (13 CL)</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 39-42: Turn, CH 2, DC in same CH Space, CH 1, (CL 1, CH 1) all around, SLST in first DC. (13 CL)</label><br><br>
        Fasten off and weave in the ends.<br><br><br>

        Cuffs, Make 2:<br>
        The cuffs will be crocheted sideways but you will start by crocheting around the end of the sleeve to make a base for it.<br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 1: Attatch the yarn with a SC into a CH Space, You will SC in each CH Space and you will do a SC DEC in every other CL. (33 ST)</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 2: CH 14, Turn, SC 13 starting in 2nd CH from hook, SC 2 into base. (13 ST)</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 3-17: SC all the way up the CH in BLO, CH 1, Turn, SC all the way down the CH in BLO, SC 2 into base, at the end just SLST into the first SC. (13 ST)</label><br><br>
        Fasten off and sew the first row to the last row, weave in ends.<br><br><br>
