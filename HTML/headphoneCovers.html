    <h1>Headphone Cover Pattern</h1>

    <!--description of the pattern-->
    <h2>
        This cover should fit just about every headphone. This pattern is only for 
        the cover not the decorations on it.
    </h2>

    <h3>Materials: 1 Yarn color: main color, Small Button, Crochet Hook, Skissors, Lardge Sewing Needle.</h3>

    <h3>Notes: These covers are very easy to decorate, I have made the flower 
        ones, some frogy ones, and even some happy face ones. You will also want 
        to use small buttons, so before sewing them on make sure they will fit 
        through the DC STs.
    </h3>

    <h3>Stitches: Magic Ring = (MR), Chain = (CH),Double Crochet = (DC), Double Crochet Increase = (DCINC), Double Crochet Decrease = (DCDEC), Slip Stitch = (SLST), Stitches = (ST).</h3>
