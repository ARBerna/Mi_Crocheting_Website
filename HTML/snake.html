    <h1>Snake Pattern</h1>

    <!--description of the pattern-->
    <h2>
        The Snake pattern is a great gift and a very cute friend. His stripes alternate 
        but the pattern does not tell you when to switch colors however if you want to 
        follow the pattern I made for the stripes I explain it later.
    </h2>

    <img src = "../IMGs/CrochetSnakePicture.jpeg" alt = "Towel Holder">

    <h3>Materials: 5 Yarn colors: Light, Medium, and Dark Green, Red and Black yarn, 
        Crochet Hook, Scissors, Lardge Sewing Needle.</h3>

    <h3>Notes: The pattern will not tell you how to add the stripes it will just say to 'crochet around' 
        but if you want to stripe the snake how I did here is how you do it: Crochet 32 RNDs in Medium Green. 
        The stripes start now and continue through the DEC rounds. 6 RNDs of Black, 5 RNDs of Dark Green, 6 RNDs of Black, 
        2 RNDs of Light Green, repeat until the end of the pattern.
    </h3>

    <h3>Stitches: Chain = (CH), Single Crochet = (SC), Increase = (INC), Decrease = (DEC), Slip Stitch = (SLST), Stitches = (ST).</h3>

    <p>Snake:<br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 1: SC 17 on the ring. (17 ST)</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 2: (CL, skip 3), CL. (5 CL)</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 3-7: CL all the way across. (5 CL)</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 8: DEC, CL, DEC. (3 CL)</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 9-13: CL all the way across. (3 CL)</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 14: DEC 2 but the end of the first DEC and the start of the second DEC are in the same CH space. (2 CL)</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 15-17: CL all the way across. (2 CL)</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 18: DC 4, CH 5, DC 4. (8 ST)</label><br><br>
        Weave in all of the ends and sew the button loosely onto RND 7. The last RND has a hook that will 
        loop around the button and around your stove handle.
