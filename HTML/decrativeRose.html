    <h1>Decrative Rose Pattern</h1>

    <!--description of the pattern-->
    <h2>This pattern is using sock yarn which is almost like a thread and that is why the roses are so small. 
        If you use normal size yarn then it will be bigger, about the size of the rose for the tank top pattern 
        on my page.</h2>

    <h3>Materials: Any color of yarn, crochet hook, skissors, optonal: glue gun.</h3>

    <h3>Notes: The size of the yarn really does depend on what you want to do. If you use 
        normal size yarn then the rose will be about the size of your wrist. I used a glue gun when 
        putting together the roses because i was going to glue them to the grad cap anyway, but 
        sewing them is not a bad idea either. You just have to make sure you leave enough string 
        to sew it together.
    </h3>

    <h3>Stitches: Chain = (CH), Half Double Crochet = (HDC), Double Crochet = (DC), Slip Stitch = (SLST).</h3>

    <p>Tank Top:<br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 1: CH 16. (16 ST)</label><br>
        <label><input type = "checkbox">RND 2: (HDC, DC 5, HDC) in each CH starting in the second CH from hook, SLST into last CH, fasten off. (106 ST)</label><br><br>
        Now roll up the petals and either sew or glue them together as you are rolling it up. And that's it!
