    <h1>Decrative Rose Pattern</h1>

    <!--description of the pattern-->
    <h2>This pattern has alot of small peices that you will have to 
        sew together and is only about three inches tall. But this is a very 
        cute wedding present, I made this for my sister's wedding and continued
        to make more as her family grew.

    <h3>Materials: 3 Colors Of Yarn: Black, White, Skin Color, Crochet Hook, Skissor, Sewing Needle, and Stuffing.</h3>

    <h3>Notes: This pattern uses the general size of yarn not small yarn. There is a lot of color 
        changing on the tuxedo. To color change, you start the stitch like normal but pull the new 
        color through the last two loops on the hook to finish the stitch. Then you will be starting 
        with the new color.
    </h3>

    <h3>Stitches: Chain = (CH), Single Crochet (SC), Back Loops Only (BLO), Increase (INC), Decrease (DEC), Slip Stitch (SLST), Magic RIng (MR), Stitches (ST).</h3>
