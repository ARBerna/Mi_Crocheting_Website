    <h1>Towel Holder Pattern</h1>

    <!--description of the pattern-->
    <h2>
        The Towel Holder is much more convenient then crocheting right onto a towel because 
        this way you can switch out your towels rather than crocheting onto twenty different 
        towels.
    </h2>

    <h3>Materials: 2 Yarn colors: Blue and White, 
        Crochet Hook, Scissors, Lardge Sewing Needle.</h3>

    <h3>Notes: The ring I used is about six inches in diameter and I also used quite a large button which 
        I sewed on loosely so that the loop made out of CHs fit nicely underneath it. Also since I changed 
        colors every round there is no CH at the start of each RND, the next RND is just attatched to the last 
        stitch.
    </h3>

    <h3>Stitches: Chain = (CH), Single Crochet = (SC), Cluster Stitch = (CL), Cluster Decend = (DEC), Slip Stitch = (SLST), Stitches = (ST).</h3>

    <h3>Special Stitches: CL = [DC 2, CH 1, DC 2], DEC = [DC 2, CH 1, DC 2 in next CH space].</h3>
