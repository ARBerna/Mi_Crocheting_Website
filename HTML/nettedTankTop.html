    <h1>Netted Tank Top Pattern</h1>

    <!--description of the pattern-->
    <h2>This pattern is about a medium but it has a corset in the back so 
        the size is adjustable.</h2>

    <img src = "../IMGs/CrochetNettedTankTop.jpg" alt = "Beanbag Chair">

    <h3>Materials: 2 Yarn colors: one main color and one color for the rose, 
        Crochet Hook, Skissors, Lardge Sewing Needle.</h3>

    <h3>Notes: The string for the corset in the back will depend on how you want it to fit. 
        You will make it as long or as short as you want. The same will be for the neck strap. 
        You will measure yourself to see how long or short you want it. The size of this tank 
        top is about a medium but the only thing you would have to change to make it bigger or 
        smaller is more/less stitches when starting the tank top.</h3>

    <h3>Stitches: Chain = (CH), Single Crochet = (SC), Half Double Crochet = (HDC), Double Crochet = (DC), Slip Stitch = (SLST).</h3>
