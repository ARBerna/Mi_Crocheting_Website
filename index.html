        <p id = "aboutMeText">I started crocheting about five years ago when my mom gave me a crochet kit. At first, I didn’t really understand it, 
            so I decided to dig a little deeper—and I ended up loving it! Now I crochet almost every single day… though I still 
            haven’t finished that original kit (oops).<br>
            As I learned more, I started creating my own patterns, which was really fun and creative. I especially love making 
            amigurumi—my bed is filled with all the different animals I’ve made. I often get inspiration from little inconveniences 
            in my life. For example, I had way too many Squishmallows on my bed, so I crocheted a net beanbag to store them.<br>
            One of my absolute favorite tools is the stitch marker. When I first started crocheting, I actually used a sewing pin 
            to mark my stitches, which meant I was constantly poking my fingers—lesson learned!<br>
            I decided to create this website to share my patterns because I know how frustrating it can be to search for patterns 
            online—so many rabbit holes and paywalls. I wanted something simpler and more accessible, especially since I crochet 
            so much anyway.<br>
            My goals with this site are to grow a following, start selling finished projects, and hopefully get paid to do something
             I truly enjoy. I hope visitors find this website easy to use, and that my patterns are clear, helpful, and fun to follow!</p><br>
